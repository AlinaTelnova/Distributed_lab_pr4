Blockchain and Decentralized Technologies. Practical task №4

The code is created in С++

The purpose of the code is to implement the RSA encryption

Additionally keys are generated using sieve of Sundaram and Euclid's algorithm

The size of keys and messages is reduced in order to speed up the program. Therefore the code can be used solely for educational purposes to demonstrate the operation of the algorithm
